  /// - Playing the [queue] from the [PlayerScreen].
  /// - Playing a [Playlist] from the home screen: should select the playlist, select the first track, and play the track.
  /// - Playing a [Playlist] from the playlist screen: should select the playlist, select the first track, and play the track.
  /// - Playing a [Track] from the [TrackScreen]: should select the track and play the track.
  /// - Play a [Track] from the [BasePlaylistScreen]: should select the track and play the track.
  /// - Toggling the play button between play and pause from either screen listen above.
  ///
  /// You can pass updateQueue as true to always reninit the player,
  /// such as double tapping a Track Row, or double tapping a playlist widget in the
  /// library sidebar.

  /// - `track` ([Track]): the track that should be played
  /// - `selectPlaylist` ([bool]): whether the playlist should be selected
  /// - `selectTrack` ([bool]): whether the track should be selected
  /// - `updateQueue` ([bool]): whether the player should be reinitialized
  /// - `index` ([int]): the index of the track to be played
