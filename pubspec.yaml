# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
version: 1.0.0+1
# Actually the build number is not optional, you may want to double check in the android dashboard for the last number.

# The `image_path` in `flutter_icons` is meant to point directly to a specific image file, 
# not a directory. This image is then used to generate the app icons, 
# sized appropriately for both Android and iOS platforms.
# Your existing configuration, with `image_path` set as `assets/icons/boxify.png`, 
# is correct as long as `boxify.png` exists inside the `assets/icons/` directory. 
# The `flutter_launcher_icons` package will take this image and generate multiple 
# sized icons required for the application launcher.
